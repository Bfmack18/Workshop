# Project 1: Dominican Republic

## Administrative Subdivisions of Dominican Republic

The Dominican Republic is a country that has two administrative levels under the countries borders, these are provinces and cities.

The main challenge that I faced was creating the borders so that it was clear as to which level was being divided. I did this by changing the thickness and color of the borders. One finding that I was able to observe was that some provinces were not divided any further, there are multiple provinces that only contain one city.

## Population of Dominican Republic's Provinces

The populaton of Dominican Republic is very concentrated within one province, Santo Domingo. This is because it contains the capital and a major city of the Dominican Republic.

The main challenge I faced here was the processing of the image, having to wait a mintute or longer between attempts was testing and lengthened the amount of time to finish this part of the project.

## Bar Graph of the Population Distribution

The bar graph confirms just how concentrated the population is within Santo Domingo. The green numbers on the map above the labels shows the density of the population (population/km^2).
