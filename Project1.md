#Project 1: Dominican Republic

## Administrative Subdivisions of Dominican Republic

The Dominican Republic is a country that has two administrative levels under the countries borders, these are provinces and cities.

The main challenge that I faced was creating the borders so that it was clear as to which level was being divided. I did this by changing the thickness and color of the borders. One finding that I was able to observe was that some provinces were not divided any further, there are multiple provinces that only contain one city.
