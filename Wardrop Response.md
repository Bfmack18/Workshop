#Response to Wardrop

Wardrop introduced the two different directions in which you can change the resolution of a data set. These approaches being top-down and bottom-up, and both are used to vary the accuracy of the given information into the appropriate size for a given goal. The top-down method is done by disaggregating the data into grid cells, moving from a large dataset to a much smaller one. One of the major problems with this method is that the final product can only be as good as the initial data, and with many countries having outdated data this makes the use of the top-down method questionable. The bottom-up method has the opposite approach, it uses small datasets to project onto a larger scale. These bottom-up methods are being used so frequently because of how quickly they can be performed and how inexpensive they can be completed. One of the major drawbacks to the use of a bottom-up method is that you rarely get validity to your estimates. Once completed countries rarely spend the time and effort to check and see if the given data is accurate, and this can bring up questions about whether or not to trust the data.
